<p><strong>I can&rsquo;t see all of the labs.</strong></p>
<p>Students may only register for the corresponding labs of courses they have taken. If you have completed a course and the corresponding lab does not appear as an option, please email <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="mailto:registration@coactive.com">registration@coactive.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m on the waitlist. When will I know if there&rsquo;s space in the Learning Lab?</strong></p>
<p>CTI will notify students on the waitlist immediately after a space has become available.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to register a guest for the Fundamentals Learning Lab.</strong></p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to bring a new-to-CTI guest to the Fundamentals Learning Lab. Please email&nbsp;<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="mailto:registration@coactive.com">registration@coactive.com</a>&nbsp;with the full name and email address of your guest, and we will create a Student Portal login for him/her. Your guest will then be able to register for the Learning Lab using the Student Portal.</p>
<p><strong>I registered, but missed my Learning Lab. Can I sign up for another date?</strong></p>
<p>You may sign up for another Learning Lab. Please select from the future dates available.</p>
